# People-Analytics-IST707-Project


# Introduction
The company offers training to individuals in the field of Data. The problem they noticed is that after training the individuals many of them leave the company and take up a job somewhere else. This is a loss to the company. The managers want us to develop a machine learning model which could predict if that individual will take up a job offer at the company or not. Predicting this would help make the selection process easier and could help train only those individuals which are going to be profitable to the company in the future. By doing so time, effort and money, all three get saved.
The problem defined is a classification task. We will be using various classification algorithms to help predict if that individual is going to take up a job at the company or not. We will also be creating an ensemble model by combining results of all the individual models.
The classification algorithms we will be using are:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting Tree 
4. Support Vector Machine

# Conclusion
Creating the Ensemble model reduces the variance of the models. We identify the precision for Class-0 as the most important metric in our case. This is because we want to be very sure of who we are training. Training a person who will not join our company can be treated as a loss to the company. The number of training hours is identified as a very important variable in decision making.
